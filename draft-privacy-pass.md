This document specifies the Privacy Pass protocol for anonymously
authenticating to services on the internet.

# Introduction

In some situations, it may only be necessary to check that a client has
previously authenticated to a service; without learning any other information.
Such lightweight authentication mechanisms can be useful in quickly assessing
the reputation of a client in latency-sensitive communication.

The Privacy Pass protocol was initially introduced as a mechanism for
authenticating clients that had previously demonstrated their `honesty`
{{DGSTV18}}. In particular, the Cloudflare content delivery network (CDN)
has implemented server-side support for the Privacy Pass protocol {{PSRV}}. This
support allows clients to bypass security mechanisms, providing that they have
successfully passed these mechanisms previously. There is also a client-side
implementation in the form of a browser extension that interacts with the
Cloudflare network {{PPEXT}}.

The main security requirement of the Privacy Pass protocol is to ensure that
previously authenticated clients do not reveal their identity on
reauthentication. The protocol uses a cryptographic primitive known as a
verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function (VOPRF) for implementing the
authentication mechanism. In particular, the VOPRF is constructed in prime-order
groups that allow it to be implemented using elliptic curve cryptography
{{OPRF}}.

In this document, we will give a formal specification of the Privacy Pass
protocol in the internet setting. In particular, we will specify how
communication is achieved over HTTP, along with secure key rotation strategies.
